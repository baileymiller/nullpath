This test suite does not require that you build or install either 
of the Field3D and OpenVDB libraries. 

In order to build the test, take the following steps:

 1 Copy the 'export' and 'src' folders from your Field3D distribution 
   into 'Field3D_here'.
 2 Copy the entire 'openvdb' folder from you OpenVDB distribution 
   into 'OpenVDB_here'
 3 'scons'
 4 Run test from build/<platform>/<architecture>/release/vdb_test
